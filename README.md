# SketchDeck chat demo

Welcome! This is our little test-project, which replicates some aspects of our project chat system.

Currently the codebase runs a basic Firestore backed Angular 5 chat application.

The goal of this exercise is to add a feature to the chatroom. This will need a bit of backend and frontend code.

This exercise is designed to take 1 - 2 days.


## The exercise

The goal is to add <kbd>@mentions</kbd> to our chat. This should look, feel and work just like Slack's version of the feature. They've done a great job of implementing theirs and more or less found the optimal design. 

### Working with us

We like to work in a collaborative, communicative manner. We'll invite you to our Slack #tech room. We expect you to:
- Ask us questions to clarify things you're uncertain about
- If you get stuck on something, ask us for help
- Collaborate with us if there's a skill you lack
- Communicate your timeline to us and give realistic estimates of when you'll hit key milestones (e.g. proof of concept, first draft, final version)
- Preview your work (UX / code / demos) early and often so we can provide helpful guidance and know how it's going
- Give a little video-demo to the tech team at the end showing the feature in action and your code


### Specification

Your solution should do the following:
1. When the user types <kbd>@</kbd> in the chat control, pop up a type-ahead pop-up menu showing 7 users they could mention
2. The pop-up should show thumbnail, chat handle, first name, last name
3. As the user types the list is sorted and filtered down to those that have matching names/emails/chat handles
4. If the user presses <kbd>enter</kbd> the highlighted user is entered into the chat text input as <kbd>@chatHandle</kbd>
5. You can decide how you want to store messages with chat handles in Firestore
6. The chat messages in the chat stream should show mentions with a light blue highlight background.


### Technical steps 

1. Get the project running by cloning this repository, installing Angular CLI, then running `npm install` and `ng serve`
2. Take `src/assets/users.json` (our mock user data) and write a function generate a unique chat handle for each user. Your function should try auto-generated handles for each user until it finds one not currently in use. FirstnameLastname or their email username are good initial candidates.
3. Create an <a href="https://algolia.com">Algolia</a> account and upload the user data there, with the chat handles
4. Get type-ahead working in the app, using Algolia as the search engine
5. Build the key handlers to implement the enter auto-complete, arrow up/down selection, and handle user backspace presses as well (e.g. if they delete the @, stop showing the menu)
6. Decide how to post the messages to FireStore
7. Show messages with mentions in them with the mention highlighted


### Bonus points

Here are a few other nice to haves:
- Email the mentioned user to let them know who said what to them. You should direct all these emails to your own address.
- Give each user their own chat bubble colour
- Add an emoji palette
- If a user sends just one emoji, show it big with no background
- Make the text input grow multiline if required







## Using the `ng` command line tool with this project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.1.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

### Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
